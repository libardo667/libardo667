Hi, I'm Levi (they/he pronouns). I am a data analyst and beginner automation developer. I primarily work in Python, but I have done work in Java and have been exploring C recently. 

I currently do freelance work for a large medical non-profit and on the website DataAnnotation.

I am here to share code with the public/potential employers and view other people's codes for ideas/inspiration. 

Please check [my portfolio](libardo667.github.io) to see an overview of me and my projects.
